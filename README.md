# Places Traveled

## Created by Angela Weber and Lara Bjork on DATE

### Project Description
This project was completed as part of the Epidocus in-class curriculum. The task description was as follows:

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

Create a website where you can keep track of all the places you've been. Each destination should be an object with multiple properties, like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc. Display those properties when a user clicks on a place's name. Complete the business logic for your place object first, before tackling the user interface. Additionally, make sure to include specifications with example input and output in your project's README.


### Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 3.3.7, JavaScript, and jQuery v3.4.1 (uncompressed development version).
Project was written using Google Chrome; no other browsers were tested for compatibility.
